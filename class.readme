Questions
---------
- if I have 5 master controllers and I lose lets say 3 of them.  leaving only 2 - if I am going to be living in that scenario for a long period of time would I need to add a third back somehow in order to maintain quorum

- more on hashi vault and secrets

- JA - I'm seeing lots of yaml files that could get confusing and I was wondering if there is a standard layout/structure that should be communicated/used
